Nishaan is a project build with a idea of making bookmarks more easy , effiecient and conventional to use , in current bookmarking system , solving the problem of current browser's bookmarking system . 


## What's the need of it?
#### There was some obviuos problem with the current bookmarking system

#### 1) Sharing Links:

- There is no direct way to send a folder of links or individual links to someone else.
#### 2) Collaboration:

 - It would be beneficial to allow multiple users to collaborate on a shared folder. Each user could perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, with an admin user managing permissions.
#### 3) Syncing Across Browsers:

 - To sync bookmarks between different browsers, you often need to enable Google Sync or a similar feature. However, not all browsers provide this functionality.
#### 4) Exporting and Sharing Bookmarks:

 - To share your bookmarks in JSON format, you first need to manually export them as a JSON file and then send the file to the recipient.
